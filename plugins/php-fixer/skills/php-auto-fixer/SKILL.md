# PHP Auto-Fixer

A PostToolUse hook runs `ecs fix` on every PHP file after each Edit or Write operation. The file is automatically reformatted and cleaned up - no manual formatting needed.

## Editing Order for `use` Statements

The fixer removes any `use` statement not referenced in the file. This creates a timing trap between consecutive edits:

1. Edit adds `use App\Model\Foo;`
2. Hook runs → `Foo` is not used anywhere → **removes the `use` statement**
3. Next Edit adds code using `Foo` → **fails because the `use` is gone**

### The Rule

Always add `use` statements in the same Edit as the code that references them. Alternatively, add the code first, then add the `use` statement in a follow-up edit.

Never add `use` statements alone in a separate Edit - they will be removed before the next edit adds the referencing code.

### Safe Patterns

**Single edit with both `use` and code** (preferred):

```php
use App\Model\UserRepository;

public function getUsers(UserRepository $repo): array
{
    return $repo->findAll();
}
```

**Code first, `use` second** (also safe):

1. First Edit: add the method body referencing `UserRepository`
2. Second Edit: add `use App\Model\UserRepository;` - now it's referenced, fixer keeps it

**`use` first, code second** (broken):

1. First Edit: add `use App\Model\UserRepository;` - fixer removes this immediately
2. Second Edit: add method body - `UserRepository` undefined

### Multiple Classes in One Edit

When adding code that references several new classes, include all their `use` statements in the same edit. Do not split `use` statements and code across separate edits.

## What the Fixer Does

- Removes unused `use` statements
- Sorts `use` statements alphabetically
- Fixes indentation, spacing, and line breaks
- Enforces PSR-12 with Nette modifications (e.g., no space before parentheses in arrow functions)

Do not manually fix formatting - the fixer handles it automatically after every edit.

## What Not to Do

- Do not remove `use` statements manually - the fixer handles unused imports
- Do not sort `use` statements manually - the fixer sorts them
- Do not fix whitespace or indentation manually - the fixer fixes it

## When the Fixer Reports Errors

The hook exits with an error when ECS cannot auto-fix all issues. Common causes:

- **PHP syntax error** in the file - fix the syntax first, fixer will run again on the next edit
- **Conflicting rules** - rare, usually resolved by re-running (edit the file again)

## Excluding Paths

To stop the fixer from touching certain paths (e.g. `fixtures` folders), add a `.nette-claude.json` file to the project root. It is shared by all Nette Claude Code hooks; each top-level key is a hook name:

```json
{
	"fix-php-style": {
		"exclude": ["fixtures*"]
	}
}
```

Patterns are gitignore-like, relative to the config file: a pattern without a slash (`fixtures`, `fixtures*`) matches a segment at any depth; a pattern with a slash (`tests/**/temp`) is a glob anchored to the config directory. The file is looked up upwards from the edited file.

## Installation

If the fixer is not installed, run `/php-fixer:install-php-fixer`.
