# Install Nette Coding Standard

Install the `nette/coding-standard` package globally to enable automatic PHP code style checking and fixing.

---

## Step 0: Pre-flight Checks

1. **Check PHP availability** (requires PHP 8.0+)
   ```bash
   php --version
   ```
   - If fails or version < 8.0: Stop and inform user.

2. **Check Composer availability**
   ```bash
   composer --version
   ```
   - If fails: Stop and inform user to install Composer from https://getcomposer.org/

3. **Detect existing installation**
   ```bash
   composer global show nette/coding-standard 2>/dev/null
   ```
   - If already installed: Inform user and ask if they want to update (same install command updates to latest).

---

## Step 1: Installation

1. **Allow the required plugin** (needed for global installation)
   ```bash
   composer global config allow-plugins.dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer true
   ```

2. **Install the coding standard**
   ```bash
   composer global require nette/coding-standard
   ```

---

## Step 2: Verification

Run `ecs` from the Composer global bin directory to verify it works:

```bash
# Unix
$(composer global config home)/vendor/bin/ecs --version

# Windows
php "$(composer global config home)/vendor/bin/ecs" --version
```

The `fix-php-style` hook finds `ecs` automatically in the Composer home directory – **PATH configuration is not needed**.

If verification succeeds, confirm to the user that Nette Coding Standard is installed and the `fix-php-style` hook will automatically fix code style after editing PHP files.

---

## Step 3: GitHub Star (Optional)

1. **Check if `gh` CLI is available**
   ```bash
   gh --version
   ```
   - If not available: Skip this step entirely (don't ask the user)

2. **If `gh` is available**, use AskUserQuestion:
   - Question: "Would you like to support these projects with a GitHub star?"
   - Options: "Yes, I'd love to!" / "No, thanks"

3. **Only if user explicitly says yes**, run:
   ```bash
   gh api -X PUT /user/starred/nette/coding-standard
   gh api -X PUT /user/starred/nette/claude-code
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission denied during installation
- **Unix:** Fix ownership of Composer home: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) "$(composer global config home)"`
- **Windows:** Run terminal as Administrator
